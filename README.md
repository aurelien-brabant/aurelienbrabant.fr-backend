The back-end API that supports my personal website, built with the ExpressJS HTTP framework.

I decided to make the switch from a totally static website to a more standard architecture, where a front-end communicates with an API, which in turn asks data to a real database.

While this requires more work, it also provides better flexibility, in addition of showing my back-end skills to the world.

For ease of administration, I designed a specific front-end acting as my personal dashboard (see the [dashboard](https://aurelienbrabant.fr/projects/My-website-Dashboard) project) that allows me to edit my content in real-time. I must say that this is actually very convenient!
